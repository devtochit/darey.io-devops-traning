SIMPLE TO-DO APPLICATION ON MERN WEB STACK

In this project we we're tasked to implement a simple to-do application on MERN stack on an AWS EC2 instance.

The MERN Web stack consists of the following components:
- MongoDB: Which is a NoSQL, document-based database used to store application data in form of a document.

- ExpressJS: A server side web application framework for Node.js.

- ReactJS: A frontend framework developed by Facebook. It is based on JavaScript, used to build User Interface (UI) components.

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.


In this project I would work on the following components of the MERN stack in making our simpe to-do application:

- backend configuration
- Install expressjs
- Models
- Mongodb database
- frontend creation
- Frontend creation (continued)
