# Project-4 MEAN STACK IMPLEMENTATION

MEAN STACK IMPLEMENTATION

MEAN Stack is a combination of following components:

1. MongoDB (Document database) – Stores and allows to retrieve data.
2. Express (Back-end application framework) – Makes requests to Database for Reads and Writes.
3. Angular (Front-end application framework) – Handles Client and Server Requests
4. Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment) – Accepts requests and displays results to end user

The following steps were taken to implement MEAN stack;

- Mean stack deployment to ubuntu in aws
  
- Install express and set up routes to the server
