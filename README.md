# PROJECT-6
WEB SOLUTION WITH WORDPRESS

In this project I will be deploying storage infrastructure on two Linux servers and implement a basic web solution using WordPress. 

Project 6 consists of two parts:

Configure storage subsystem for Web and Database servers based on Linux OS. The focus of this part is to give you practical experience of working with disks, partitions and volumes in Linux.

Install WordPress and connect it to a remote MySQL database server. This part of the project will solidify your skills of deploying Web and DB tiers of Web solution.
